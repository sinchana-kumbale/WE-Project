# Welcome to InMobile!

Welcome to InMobile - An App that aims to make **Public Transport**  more **Accessible** in India. It was crafted using  _ReactNative_.

The Features that are currently incorporated or in the works include :

-   The Basic Login and Sign up structure including a forgot password page with efficient error handling
-   The User Home page categorized based on the city chosen 

> Due to the Dataset limitation, information currently available only for :  Bangalore, Gurugram, Pune, Bhubaneshwar, Delhi and Hyderabad.

-   The User's Current location as depicted on Google Maps using the Maps API along with appropriate permissions and authorizations.
-   The User's _From_ and _To_ information is collected  
> Unfortunately, the search feature could not be integrated due to the paid nature of Places API and Directions API.
-  A list of all available public transport along with average cost is displayed
> Currently only for Bangalore, but in the works for other cities.
-  A final Thank you page for the user
